omniture CHANGELOG
-----------------
  
7.x-2.2 Mon, Feb 06, 2012
  [BUGFIX]
  * removed 'updated' field from _omniture_selectors_get_entry_fields_from_form_state_by_id() function as it is just a field for updating purposes but not to be saved on the database. As it is not a field on the table, it was causing an error on submission.
